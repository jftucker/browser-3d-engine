<span id="why">
  <p>
    If you were to read my resume (indeed, linkedin), you would likely be worried that I don't have the ability to hit the ground running because I don't have any history as a professional programmer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I built this because I have not yet been employed full time as a software engineer, but have been working diligently to become one. This demonstrates things that my work history cannot, and it solves the problem of a lack of work history being representative of my problem solving ability.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I write clean, concise, maintainable code.</li> 
    <li>I'm familiar with design patterns.</li>
    <li>I understand Object Oriented Programming fundamentals.</li>
    <li>I can learn solutions to complex tasks quickly. (This took about a week, with no prior 3D knowledge.)</li>
    <li>I won't get hung up on hard math.</li>
    <li>I understand JavaScript.</li>
    <li>I try to find creative solutions to problems, from the perspective of the person who matters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I may be a little biased, but I also think I'm pretty easy to be around. I want to be on your team, I want to contribute, I'm friendly with my coworkers.
  </p>
  <p>Over-all I think I'm a pretty good hire. I'm just a dedicated engineer, looking to shift from mechanical stuff to software stuff, and I'd like you to take a chance on me.</p>

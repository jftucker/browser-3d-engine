          If you were to read my resume (<a
            href="https://my.indeed.com/p/johnt-fwhdzsz"
            target="blank"
            >indeed</a
          >,
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-tucker/" target="blank"
            >linkedin</a
          >), you would likely be worried that I don't have the ability to hit
          the ground running because all of my professional programming
          experience comes from my work as a mechanical engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built this because I have not yet been employed full time as a
          software engineer, but have been working diligently to write code in a
          professional way within my previous roles. This project solves the
          problem of a lack of work history being representative of my problem
          solving ability.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I write clean, concise, maintainable code.</li>
          <li>I'm familiar with design patterns.</li>
          <li>I understand Object Oriented Programming fundamentals.</li>
          <li>
            I can learn solutions to complex tasks quickly. (This took about a
            week, with no prior 3D knowledge.)
          </li>
          <li>I won't get hung up on hard math.</li>
          <li>I understand JavaScript.</li>
          <li>
            I try to find creative solutions to problems, from the perspective
            of the stakeholders.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I may be a little biased, but I also think I'm pretty easy to be
          around. I want to be on your team, I want to contribute, I'm friendly
          with my coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over-all I think I'm a pretty good hire. I'm just a dedicated
          engineer, looking to shift from mechanical stuff to software stuff,
          and I'd like you to take a chance on me.

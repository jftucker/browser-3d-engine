          If you were to read my resume (
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-tucker/" target="blank"
            >linkedin</a
          >), you would see that I'm a pretty unique candidate with a lot of 
          history in Mechanical, Aerospace, and Software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built this because I wanted to present a clear demonstration of the 
          type of code that I write, and my ability to break hard problems down 
          into managable parts.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I write clean, concise, maintainable code.</li>
          <li>I'm familiar with design patterns.</li>
          <li>
            I can learn solutions to complex tasks quickly. (This took about a
            week, with no prior 3D knowledge.)
          </li>
          <li>I won't get hung up on difficult problems.</li>
          <li>I understand the fundamentals of software development.</li>
          <li>
            I consider the stakeholders when finding creative solutions to problems.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm pretty easy to be around. I want to be on your team, I want to 
          contribute, I'm friendly with my coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over-all I think I'm a pretty good hire. I'm just a dedicated
          engineer, striving always to get better at my craft. I'd like to write 
          some clean code along the way.
